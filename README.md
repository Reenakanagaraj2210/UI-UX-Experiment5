# UI-UX-Experiment5
Present 2 different UX project scenarios (e.g., designing a health app, an e-commerce site, or a government service portal).
## Aim:
To analyze, define, and design user-centered solutions for two different digital product scenarios (Health App and Government Service Portal) 
using UX methods such as problem identification, user research, persona creation, and visual design prototyping in Figma.


## Algorithm:
